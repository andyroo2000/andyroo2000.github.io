Learning to write code has been very similar to my experience learning Japanese.

When I was learning Japanese, there was a period of around 6 months before I moved to Japan that I was certain I was going. At this point, I became consumed with the study of Japanese, spending all my waking hours absorbing podcasts, learning characters etc. Of course, my learning grew exponentially once I arrived. It wasn't just being surrounded by the language, since I was already doing that in the U.S. thanks to the magic of the internet. The thing that is difficult to replicate is the visceral feeling of using the language to communicate with real people when it is vital for survival. There's no book that can give you the adrenaline rush that you get when you try out your Japanese on an impatient bar owner for the first time. An hour of conversing in a bar is worth five hours of studying flash cards.

So here I am, preparing for arrival... using every resource available and immersing myself completely. The other thing that is familiar about this experience is that when learning something like a language, you try to learn the same concepts many times before they feel natural. You try so many sources and then something clicks with one of them and you think, "This is the best book ever". Of course, the truth is that the knowledge wore you down and if you keep trying to understand something from enough angles, one of them is going to make sense to you.

On that note, I'm re-reading [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and it's seeming like the best book ever. Bonus: the free version online has little coding challenges with hidden solutions that can be revealed after you've worked it out on your own. I've also been reading [Secrets of a JavaScript Ninja](http://www.manning.com/resig/), which is also fantastic, but yeah... the right book at the right time is a wonderful thing.
