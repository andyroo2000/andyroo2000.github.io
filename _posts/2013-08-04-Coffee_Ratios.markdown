I'm working through some jQuery tutorials at the moment and just wanted to get away from the practice files and make something simple, so that I'm applying what I'm learning to my own code. I actually have a native mobile app that calculates coffee ratios, but I wanted a back-up solution, in case my phone isn't nearby or the battery is dead.

I plan on adding some features to it later, such as the ability to change measurement units, the coffee to water ratio, and maybe a slider for data input... but this works for now.
