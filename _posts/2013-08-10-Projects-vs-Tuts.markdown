I've found that a huge motivator in learning to code is working on a live project and having something to show for your efforts. I've done my share of tutorials and read enough books, but if you're not careful, they can become a *huge* time-sink.

The problem is that when you learn something without a useful context (i.e. a real project), it doesn't occupy the same space in your head that is reserved for things you actually use. It sits in the waiting room of your brain until the end of the day. Then your brain closes for the evening and the knowledge goes home.

That said, I'm going to not have anything too interesting to post for a few days, because I'm going to be in tutorial-land doing some [jQuery](http://zfer.us/0o7st) and [Sass](http://zfer.us/uU8RN) tutorials on CodeSchool. As soon as I see anything that looks useful, I'll come back and try and apply it to something immediately. Otherwise, I may as well be huffing paint, because using it is the only way to level up.
