The past week has been a whirlwind of activity...

In the past week, I thought I might be going to Hacker School, stopped
everything I was doing and tried to optimize my learning toward that end.

I won't go into the graphic details, but I will say that the coding challenge
was um... *challenging* for me. I worked around the clock over the Labor Day
weekend and declined to look
at working solutions which I knew existed on the internet. After thinking I had
solved it on my own and feeling like a genius, I realized that I was actually getting the
wrong answer... There was a logical error and I was unable to find it in time
for my interview/pairing session.

Such is life, but the experience taught me a lot.
* Working on a challenging problem is extremely fun!
* Using JavaScript to solve a non-trivial problem showed me that I had a very
  shallow understanding of the language.
* All of this dabbling in different languages and frameworks had not made me a
  better programmer. I needed to focus on learning a language deeply.

After some soul searching, I took stock of my current skills and decided to
make a plan to right my wrongs.

While I have some experience with Ruby and C, I've mostly been interested in
technologies related to JavaScript. With all of the incredible things being
done with JavaScript these days, it seems that those with a deep understanding
of JavaScript will be required to make the most powerful web apps in the
forseeable future.

One of the big drawbacks seems to be that there are way better learning
resources for those learning Ruby or Python. However, I feel that I know
JavaScript the best at this point, so it makes sense to build on my strengths
than to start over with something else. Also, I feel like there are already so
many people learning Ruby and that the world really needs more people to be
learning JavaScript. The semicolons, curly-braces, and camelCase don't scare
me, so I might as well.

After making this decision, I looked around on ye olde Google to see if anyone
had any sage advice for those wishing to *really* learn JavaScript and found
[How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/).

Much of it, I already know, but I like the very specific nature of the learning
strategy. There is no jumping around and trying to figure out what to learn
next. There is just moving forward. And when I'm done with that, there's [Learn
Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript](http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-intermediate-and-advanced-javascript/).

So, my course is clear... I'm taking a break to master the fundamentals and
spend as much time as possible typing, tweaking and writing code. That is
perhaps the biggest thing I learned while working on the problem that I never
completely solved: by attempting to solve a complex problem, I was gaining a
more intimate knowledge of JavaScript. There was enough sustained effort that
the syntax melted away and I was just thinking about the logic and how to
break the problem into smaller parts. Although I didn't solve it in time, I
thoroughly enjoyed myself doing it and I will try and recreate those
circumstances during the course of learning JavaScript as much as possible.
