This is my master-list of coding resources... out of order and all in one place.

The purpose of this is to point you in the right direction when you're thinking, "I have too much free time. I wonder if there is something I could be looking at that's web-related."


## General Online Learning Resources

- [Codacademy](http://www.codecademy.com) - This is probably where you should start if you are completely new to programming. They offer an easy introduction to the basic concepts of coding.

- [CodeSchool](http://codeschool.com) - Very polished tutorials with videos and coding excercises. It costs, but they have a free trial, and it might be worth subscribing for a month or two if you have the time to spend going through their excercises. I'd recommend trying this after you get the basics down using Codecademy. CodeSchool does a better job of spoonfeeding you some of the more advanced concepts.

- [TeamTreehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) - I'd recommend signing up for their free trial and watching videos on a concept you're having trouble with. Their videos are extremely easy to follow and when you're starting out, these are worth watching. I'm not a huge fan of their multiple choice questions, but I think you'll learn a lot if you just casually watch the videos.

- [Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com) - This is a great site with very up-to-date video tutorials. They tend to move quickly, so I might steer clear of these until you're a little more comfortable programming. These tutorials are great, but they move so quickly that you'll be lost if you try to follow them when you're first starting out.

- [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com) - This is the largest premium tutorial site in the world. There are some great classes on Lynda, but there's also a lot of old information and I'd recommend saving Lynda.com for some point in the future when you need some weird tutorial that doesn't exist somewhere else.

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) - This is sort of a marketplace for video tutorials. There are some excellent courses on Udemy, but some of them are pricey and you definitely want to read the user reviews before making a purchase. I haven't purchased any Udemy tutorials myself, but I've gone through some of their free classes and I've definitely seen some classes that look worth taking.


## In-Person Instruction

- [Bootcamper](http://bootcamper.io) - An extremely thorough list of all the intensive coding bootcamps. They are all generally somewhat pricey and the best ones are difficult to get into (I tried to get into both Hack Reactor and HackerSchool multiple times and was not accepted). That said, if you can make it happen, any of these will probably accelerate your learning tremendously. However, if you're patient and persistent, you can definitely become a professional programmer without attending a single class.

- [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly) - An excellent source of in-person instruction in NYC. For me, they hit the sweet spot between excellent serious instruction and time-commitment and cost. I haven't taken any of their courses, but I've heard good things from people who hire programmers.


## Sites Like This (getting meta in here)

- [Project Odin](http://www.theodinproject.com/home) - This is an open-source curriculum that takes you from zero to professional [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) developer. While my site is geared toward those learning JavaScript, all of the stuff on this site about HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Git, and jQuery totally applies to what we're doing here. I'd highly recommend checking this site out, picking a thing you don't know and following some of the steps outlined on this site. There also happens to be a [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/codecrewny/events/199566412/?a=ea1_grp&rv=ea1&_af_eid=199566412&_af=event) for people following this cirriculum in NYC.

- [Metis prework](https://github.com/thisismetis/prework) - [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com) is an intensive Ruby on Rails bootcamp from [thoughbot](http://thoughtbot.com), which is a well-regarded Rails consultancy. Although, this is the pre-work for entering the course, anyone just starting out in web devlopment could benefit from it.

- [Flatiron School prework](http://prework.flatironschool.com) - [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com) is a well-regarded Ruby on Rails bootcamp in NYC, and their pre-work is also a good resource for beginners.
