I went to the [NYC Web Design Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nyc-web-design/events/135169182/) tonight and saw a really cool presentation by the tech evangelist from [Green Sock](http://www.greensock.com).

Green Sock used to develop tools for Flash developers, but as the world has turned its back on Flash, they have ported most of their tools to work with JavaScript. It's not open source, but their animation library/toolset is based on a freemium model, so it's free to use unless you are charging end-users. And if you are doing heavy animation work, it seems that it would be worth the modest licensing fee, since they give you some powerful animation tools that you may miss if you've ever done any Flash development, but that work using JavaScript and have performance that destroys jQuery animation (which is to be expected) and even bests CSS animation in FPS.

The library, depending on the options you load, weighs in at about 26k and it seems to make the business of animating in JavaScript much easier. After watching an hour-long presentation and playing around with some of their examples on CodePen, I more or less have the hang of it. I'm already thinking of a project that it might be nice to use it on.
