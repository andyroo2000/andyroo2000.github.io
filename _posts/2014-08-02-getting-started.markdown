## Your code, your text editor

[Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) is the text editor that I recommend using. There are many text editors for coders and people tend to have strong opinions about them, but I'm recommending Sublime Text because it's very beginner friendly, yet still very powerful, and because it's really a great text editor. Because it is so popular, there are [tons](https://sublime.wbond.net/browse/popular) of great plugins that extend the functionality. Again, don't overthink this... Sublime is an excellent editor and there are more important things to worry about right now.

Speaking of extending the functionality of Sublime Text, the first thing you should do after installing it, is to install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation). This makes it extremely easy to install plugins. This is completely necessary, so do this immediately.

To get started I recommend finding out how to install a Sublime Text plugin using Package Controll (Google it!) and install the following packages:

- [Emmet](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Emmet) can save a lot of time when writing HTML and CSS. I recommend watching the video [demo](http://emmet.io) and referring back to the [cheat sheet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet) in order to take advantage of the most useful shortcuts.

- [Sidebar Enhancements](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SideBarEnhancements) is not absolutely necessary, but makes the sidebar much more useful.

- [Sublime Code Intel](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeCodeIntel) adds much better auto-completion to Sublime Text. Aside from being quicker, using auto-completion (when possible) is a great way to reduce typos.

- [Bracket Highlighter](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/BracketHighlighter) makes it easier to see pairs of matching brackets and give you a better visual cue when your cursor is between a pair of brackets. The screenshots on their site should give you an idea of what this plugin does.

- [jQuery](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/jQuery) is a plugin that will allow Sublime Text to autocomplete jQuery methods for you. You might not even know exactly what that means right now, but it will come in handy when we start learning jQuery. Again, not strictly necessary, but I'm in favor of anything that does grunt work for you.

- [AutoFileName](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/AutoFileName) will allow Sublime Text to autocomplete file names of other files in your project. This will be extremely useful when linking to files, as computers are very unforgiving of typos. Again, this one might not seem so useful now, but you will come to appreciate it later. Definitely look at the instructions for this one as the autocomplete requires a key-command of `ctrl-space` to work.

- [Advanced New File](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/AdvancedNewFile) adds the ability to create a new directory and name your file all without touching your mouse. This may seem like a small optimization, but you will save a lot of time if you get used to using this feature. Again, you'll have to consult the documentation for instructions, as a special key-command is required to use Advanced New File.

- [Dayle Reese Color Schemes](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Dayle%20Rees%20Color%20Schemes) is entirely optional, but it's a nice little collection of color schemes for Sublime in one easy-to-install bundle.

- [Sublime Linter](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/installation.html) is going to be your new friend. It will automatically check your code as you are typing and point out the errors you are making. This is going to be the trickiest on for you to install, so block off a little time to make sure you get this one installed correctly. You'll have to install Sublime Linter and then install [SublimeLinter-jshint](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-jshint), which will specifically tell you when you have errors in your JavaScript.

If you want to see someone explain some Sublime Text power-user stuff in video form, please check out the excellent tutorial on Tuts+, [Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text 2](http://courses.tutsplus.com/courses/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-2). You might not absorb everything in the videos, but it will give you a sense of what is possible when you master your text editor. FYI, the video is free to watch after you sign up for a free account with Tuts+.
