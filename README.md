# My Jekyll Blog

This is a blog I created using Jekyll, which is hosted at http://andyroo2000.github.io

It was largely an experiment, using Jekyll and using Sass (SCSS) to style it, as the default styling is... minimal.

I have since moved my blog to: http://andrew-landry.com and I'm using the Ghost blogging engine to power it and hosting it on a Digital Ocean droplet.

However, Jekyll is a pretty good command-line app for blogging, and I really do like being able to edit my posts in Vim.
